# Change Log

## [6.0.2.1]

### Build

- **Clang 9:** We now support building using Clang 9. (#252)

### Procedural

- **Primvar translation:** The procedural now uses "primvars:st" and "primvars:uv" for UV coordinates, and "normals" for "nlist" on polymeshes. (#206)
- **Per-vertex UV and Normals:** Per-vertex UVs and normals are now supported on polymeshes. (#222)
- **Shader output connections:** Support for shader output connections has been improved, including per-component connections. (#211)
- **Point varying primvars:** Varying primvars are now supported on point schemas. (#228)
- **USDVol support:** The procedural now supports USD Volumes schemas. Using grids from two different files for a single volume is not allowed. (#227)
- **Serialized USD:** The procedural supports creating the stage from a set of strings without requiring a file. (#235)
- **Basis Curves:** The procedural now supports Basis Curves. (#239)
- **Boolean parameters:** The procedural now supports setting boolean parameters on Arnold nodes using bool, int or long USD attributes. (#238)
- **Converting between Width and Radius:** Width attributes are now properly converted to Arnold's radius parameters. (#247)
- **RTLD_LOCAL:** RTLD_LOCAL is used instead of RTLD_GLOBAL when dlopening in the procedural. (#259)

### Render Delegate

- **Left Handed Topology:** Left-handed topologies are now supported, including converting the varying primvars and indices for position, normal and uv attributes. (#207)
- **Motion Key mismatch:** Normal and position motion keys counts are the same now. (#229)
- **RGBA Primvars:** RGBA primvars are now supported. (#236)
- **Hydra Point Instancer:** Support of the Point Instancer has been greatly improved, including instancing of volumes. (#18 and #123)
- **Uniform Primvars:** Uniform primvars on points are now supported.
- **Pixel format conversion:** The render buffers now converts between pixel formats correctly. (#245)
- **Light Dirtying:** Transforms are now correctly preserved when parameters are dirtied, but transforms are unchanged on lights. (#243)

### Schemas

- **Linux Build:** Building schemas using for Arnold 6.0.2.0 is now supported on Linux. (#219)

### Writer 

- **Node names for attributes:** Node names are now correctly formatted and sanitized when writing node and node array attributes. (#208)
