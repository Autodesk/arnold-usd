# Change Log

## [6.0.3.0]

### Build

- **USD requirement:** USD 19.05 is now the earliest supported version.
- **USD 20.02:** USD 20.02 is now supported. (#260)

- Fixed build issues on Linux and MacOS. (#303)
- Fixed build issues when using USD 0.19.05.

### Procedural

- **Using the new instancer procedural:** The procedural now uses the core shipped instancer procedural. (#256)
- **Prim Visibility:** The visibility token from UsdGeomImageable is now correctly inherited. (#218)

- Fixed a crash when using the Arnold Viewport functions. (#295)
- Fixed a crash when writing USD files with upper-case extensions. (#288)

### Render Delegate

- **Computed Primvars:** Computed primvars are now supported, enabling previewing UsdSkel and Houdini crowds. (#265 and #267)
- **Improved Rendering:** The Render Delegate is now using the Arnold Render API correctly, leading to better responsiveness. (#270)
- **Improved Render Buffers:** The Hydra Render Buffer support is now significantly improved, including improved performance. (#8)
- **32-bit buffers:** The render delegate now outputs 32-bit float buffers, instead of dithered 8 bit whenever possible. (#9)
- **arnold:global: prefix:** Prefixing Render Settings with `arnold:global:` is now supported.
- **Shaping Parameters:** Shaping parameters on Sphere Lights are now supported. This includes Spot and IES parameters, excluding IES normalize and IES angle scale. (#314)
- **Barndoor Parameters:** Solaris' Barndoor parameters are now roughly approximated using the barndoor filter. Note, Arnold *does NOT match* Karma. (#332)

- Fixed a crash when instancer nodes had uninitialized node pointers. (#298)
- Fixed a bug with aborted renders not marking the render pass as converged. (#4)
- Fixed a bug where the camera jumped to the origin in Solaris. (#385)

### Scene Format/Writer

- **Mask:** The scene format plugin now supports a mask parameter, allowing selective export of Arnold nodes. (#274)
- **Closures:** Closure attributes are now written to the USD file. (#322)
- **Options:** The options node is now correctly translated. (#320)

- Fixed bugs with the string export functions. (#320)
- Fixed a crash when writing pointer attributes. (#342)

## [6.0.2.1]

### Build

- **Clang 9:** We now support building using Clang 9. (#252)

### Procedural

- **Primvar translation:** The procedural now uses "primvars:st" and "primvars:uv" for UV coordinates, and "normals" for "nlist" on polymeshes. (#206)
- **Per-vertex UV and Normals:** Per-vertex UVs and normals are now supported on polymeshes. (#222)
- **Shader output connections:** Support for shader output connections has been improved, including per-component connections. (#211)
- **Point varying primvars:** Varying primvars are now supported on point schemas. (#228)
- **USDVol support:** The procedural now supports USD Volumes schemas. Using grids from two different files for a single volume is not allowed. (#227)
- **Serialized USD:** The procedural supports creating the stage from a set of strings without requiring a file. (#235)
- **Basis Curves:** The procedural now supports Basis Curves. (#239)
- **Boolean parameters:** The procedural now supports setting boolean parameters on Arnold nodes using bool, int or long USD attributes. (#238)
- **Converting between Width and Radius:** Width attributes are now properly converted to Arnold's radius parameters. (#247)
- **RTLD_LOCAL:** RTLD_LOCAL is used instead of RTLD_GLOBAL when dlopening in the procedural. (#259)

### Render Delegate

- **Left Handed Topology:** Left-handed topologies are now supported, including converting the varying primvars and indices for position, normal and uv attributes. (#207)
- **Motion Key mismatch:** Normal and position motion keys counts are the same now. (#229)
- **RGBA Primvars:** RGBA primvars are now supported. (#236)
- **Hydra Point Instancer:** Support of the Point Instancer has been greatly improved, including instancing of volumes. (#18 and #123)
- **Uniform Primvars:** Uniform primvars on points are now supported.
- **Pixel format conversion:** The render buffers now converts between pixel formats correctly. (#245)
- **Light Dirtying:** Transforms are now correctly preserved when parameters are dirtied, but transforms are unchanged on lights. (#243)

### Schemas

- **Linux Build:** Building schemas using Arnold 6.0.2.0 is now supported on Linux. (#219)

### Writer 

- **Node names for attributes:** Node names are now correctly formatted and sanitized when writing node and node array attributes. (#208)
