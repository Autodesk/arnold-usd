Build Instructions
==================

Arnold USD is currently supported and tested on Windows, Linux and Mac.

## Dependencies

It is advised to use the same dependencies used to build USD, or the current VFX platform. We target USD versions starting from v19.01 up to the latest commit on the dev branch.

Python and Boost are optional if USD was build without Python support.

| Name | Version | Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arnold | 5.4+ | |
| USD | v19.05 - dev | |
| Python | 2.7 |  x  |
| Boost | 1.55 (Linux), 1.61 (Mac, Windows VS 2015), 1.65.1 (Windows VS 2017) or 1.66.0 (VFX platform) |  x  |
| TBB | 4.4 Update 6 or 2018 (VFX platform) | |

### Windows 10 & Python

Newer releases of Windows 10 ship with a set of app shortcuts that open the Microsoft Store to install Python 3 instead of executing the Python interpreter available in the path. This feature breaks the `abuild` script. To disable this, open the _Settings_ app, and search for _Manage app execution aliases_. On this page turn off any shortcut related to Python.

## Building

Builds can be configured by either creating a `custom.py` file in the root of the cloned repository, or by passing the build flags to the `abuild` script. Once the configuration is set, use the `abuild` script to build the project and `abuild install` to install the project. Using `-j` when executing `abuild` instructs SCons to use multiple cores. For example: `abuild -j 8 install` will use 8 cores to build the project.

Sample `custom.py` files are provided in the _Examples_ section below.

### Build Options
- `MODE`: Sets the compilation mode, `opt` for optimized builds, `debug` for debug builds, and `profile` for optimized builds with debug information for profiling.
- `WARN_LEVEL: Warning level, `strict` enables errors for warnings, `warn-only` prints warnings and `none` turns of errors.
- `COMPILER`: Compiler to use. `gcc` or `clang` (default is `gcc`) on Linux and Mac, and `msvc` on Windows.
- `BUILD_SCHEMAS`: Whether or not to build the schemas and their wrapper.
- `BUILD_RENDER_DELEGATE`: Whether or not to build the hydra render delegate.
- `BUILD_NDR_PLUGIN`: Whether or not to build the node registry plugin.
- `BUILD_USD_WRITER`: Whether or not to build the arnold to usd writer tool.
- `BUILD_PROCEDURAL`: Whether or not to build the arnold procedural.
- `BUILD_TESTSUITE`: Whether or not to build the testsuite.
- `BUILD_DOCS`: Whether or not to build the documentation.
- `DISABLE_CXX11_ABI`: Disabling the new C++ ABI introduced in GCC 5.1.

Note, `static` only supported when building the procedural and the usd -> ass converter.

## Examples

### Building on Linux

This simple example `custom.py` builds the project on Linux, against the system Python libraries and a monolithic USD build.

~~~python
ARNOLD_PATH='/opt/autodesk/arnold-5.4.0.0'
USD_PATH='/opt/pixar/USD'
USD_BUILD_MODE='monolithic'
BOOST_INCLUDE='/usr/include'
PYTHON_INCLUDE='/usr/include/python2.7'
PYTHON_LIB='/usr/lib'
PYTHON_LIB_NAME='python2.7'
PREFIX='/opt/autodesk/arnold-usd'
~~~

This is the same configuration, this time passed directly to `abuild` on the command line:

~~~bash
abuild ARNOLD_PATH='/opt/autodesk/arnold-5.4.0.0' USD_PATH='/opt/pixar/USD' USD_BUILD_MODE='monolithic' BOOST_INCLUDE='/usr/include' PYTHON_INCLUDE='/usr/include/python2.7' PYTHON_LIB='/usr/lib' PYTHON_LIB_NAME='python2.7' PREFIX='/opt/autodesk/arnold-usd'
~~~

### Building for USD 20.05 and later on Linux

USD 20.05 requires GCC 6.3.1 and the use of C++-14. This can be achieved using the following snippet on CentOS 7. For other OSes replace the SHCXX line with a path to your local g++ 6.3.1 and later installation.

~~~python
SHCXX='/opt/rh/devtoolset-6/root/usr/bin/g++'
CXX_STANDARD='14'
DISABLE_CXX11_ABI=True
~~~

### Building for Houdini

We support building against the libraries shipping with Houdini 18.0+ and using the render delegate in the Solaris viewport. As of now (18.0.287) Houdini does not ship `usdGenSchema`, so the schemas target cannot be built against Houdini. Houdini prefixes standard USD library names with `libpxr_` (i.e. `libusd.so` becomes `libpxr_usd.so`), which can be configured via the `USD_LIB_PREFIX` variable. On Linux and macOS, Boost libraries are prefixed with `h`, on Windows Boost libraries are prefixed with `h` and suffixed with `-mt` (i.e. `boost_python.lib` becomes `hboost_python-mt.lib`), which requires setting the `BOOST_LIB_NAME` variable.

#### Mac

Here's an example `custom.py` for the default installation of Houdini 18.0.287 on macOS:

~~~python
ARNOLD_PATH='/opt/solidAngle/arnold'

#### Linux

Example `custom.py` for the default installation of Houdini 18.0.287 on Linux using the system's Python. Note, Houdini 18 requires the use of GCC 6.3.1 and C++ 14. The example is for a CentOS 7 installation, replace the value of SHCXX line with a path to your local install of GCC 6.3.1 and later if using a different distro.

~~~python

## Examples

In our examples we create a subfolder inside the source repository named `build` then run the cmake cmake configuration from there.

Note, we are setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release` in all the examples.

### Building on Linux

This example configures the project on Linux against a USD built using the official build scripts. In our example USD is installed at `/opt/USD`, google test is at `/opt/googletest`/, arnold is at `/opt/arnold`. We are using GCC 6.3.1+, see your distribution specific instructions for using the approprate GCC. Once configuration is done, you can use `make` and `make install` to build and install the project.

```
cmake ..
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 -DARNOLD_LOCATION=/opt/arnold
 -DUSD_LOCATION=/opt/USD
 -DTBB_FOUND=ON
 -DTBB_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/USD/include
 -DTBB_LIBRARIES=/opt/USD/lib/libtbb.so
 -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/USD
 -DBUILD_UNIT_TESTS=ON
 -DGOOGLETEST_LOCATION=/opt/googletest
 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/arnold-usd
```

This example builds the project against a standard, symlinked, installation of Houdini 18 on Centos. In our example Arnold is installed at `/opt/arnold`. We are using GCC 6.3.1+, see your distribution specific instructions for using the approprate GCC.

```
cmake ..
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 -DARNOLD_LOCATION=/opt/arnold
 -DUSD_LIB_PREFIX=libpxr_
 -DUSD_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/hfs18.0/toolkit/include
 -DUSD_LIBRARY_DIR=/opt/hfs18.0/dsolib
 -DBUILD_USE_CUSTOM_BOOST=ON
 -DBUILD_SCHEMAS=OFF
 -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/hfs18.0/toolkit/include/hboost
 -DBoost_LIBRARIES=/opt/hfs18.0/dsolib/libhboost_python.so
 -DTBB_FOUND=ON
 -DTBB_INCLUDE_DIRS=/opt/hfs18.0/toolkit/include
 -DTBB_LIBRARIES=/opt/hfs18.0/dsolib/libtbb.so
 -DBUILD_DISABLE_CXX11_ABI=ON
 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/arnold-usd
```

### Building on Windows

On windows, it's also an option to use [https://cmake.org/runningcmake/](cmake-gui), instead of the command line.

This example configures arnold-usd for Houdini 18.0.499 on Windows using the default installation folder, with arnold installed at `C:\arnold`. Note, as of 18.0.499, Houdini lacks inclusion of usdgenschema, so we have to disable generating the custom schemas.

```
cmake ..
 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\dist\arnold-usd"
 -DARNOLD_LOCATION="C:\arnold"
 -DUSD_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\toolkit\include"
 -DUSD_LIBRARY_DIR="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\custom\houdini\dsolib"
 -DUSD_LIB_PREFIX=libpxr_
 -DBUILD_SCHEMAS=OFF
 -DTBB_FOUND=ON
 -DTBB_INCLUDE_DIRS="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\toolkit\include"
 -DTBB_LIBRARIES="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\custom\houdini\dsolib\tbb.lib"
 -DBUILD_USE_CUSTOM_BOOST=ON
 -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIRS="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\toolkit\include\hboost"
 -DBoost_LIBRARIES="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\custom\houdini\dsolib\hboost_python-mt.lib"
 -DPython2_ROOT_DIR="C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 18.0.499\python27"
```
