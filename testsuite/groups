# groups
#
# This file maps all testgroups (elements on the left hand side) with their respective tests. You can also
# have a local file (groups.local) with the same format, where you can override any group in this file.
#
#  Notes:
#    - Tests can be listed in as many groups as needed.
#    - Groups can be recursively added to other groups.
#    - A special group called 'ignore' contains tests that will never be run (you can use it to temporarily
#      disable some tests or groups)
#    - There is a special group per supported OS, where you can add tests that will ONLY be run for that
#      specific OS (linux, darwin, windows).
#
# The following command will find all tests that contain a specific keyword (e.g. polymesh):
#
#    > grep polymesh testsuite/test*/data/*.ass | cut -f 2 -d '/' | sort -u
#
# This can help in making sure that a group contains almost all relevant tests.  Note that it's still
# possible to miss some tests (like with procedurally generated content) or to find things you don't want
# (such as this_is_not_a_polymesh being returned for tests that use polymesh).

ignore: test_0011 test_0040 test_0062 test_0068
# Notes: - test_0011 needs alembic - test_0040 needs the writer to be compiled - 
# tests 62 and 68 are causing issues on linux, because the output component connection isn't set properly
